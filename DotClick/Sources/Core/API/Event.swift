/**
 *  Class that represents an event that can occur in a game
 *
 *  You use this class to observe and trigger events that can happen
 *  in your game, and is the recommended way to drive most of your
 *  game logic.
 *
 *  To observe an event, simply call the `observe` method on it:
 *
 *  ```
 *  actor.events.moved.observe { actor in
 *      print("This actor was moved: \(actor)")
 *  }
 *  ```
 *
 *  To define a custom event, create an extension on `EventCollection`
 *  that defines a computed property for your event, and simply call
 *  `makeEvent()` within its implementation, like this:
 *
 *  ```
 *  extension EventCollection where Object == Actor {
 *      var myEvent: Event<Actor, Void> {
 *          return makeEvent()
 *      }
 *  }
 *  ```
 *
 *  You can then trigger the event like this:
 *
 *  ```
 *  actor.events.myEvent.trigger()
 *  ```
