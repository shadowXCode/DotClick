    Imagine Engine is an ongoing project that aims to create a fast, high-performace Swift 2D game engine for Apple's platforms that is also a joy to use.
    While there are still ways to go, things to fix and new capabilities to add, you are invited to participate in this new community to build a tool with
    an ambitious but clear goal - to enable you to easily build any game that you can imagine.
