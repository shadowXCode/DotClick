/**
 *  Token returned when an action was performed
 *
 *  You can use an action token to either cancel an action, or to observe when
 *  it was finished. You can also use it to chain an ongoing action to another
 *  one, making it automatically performed once the current action has finished.
 *
 *  Here's an example of how to cancel an action:
 *
 *  ```
 *  let token = actor.move(byX: 50, y: 300, duration: 5)
 *  token.cancel()
 *  ```
 *
 *  Here's how you can run a closure whenever an action was finished:
 *
 *  ```
 *  actor.move(byX: 50, y: 300, duration: 5).then {
 *      print("Move finished!")
 *  }
 *  ```
 *
 *  Here's how an action can be chained into another:
 *
 *  ```
 *  actor.move(byX: 50, y: 300, duration: 5)
 *       .then(actor.fadeOut(withDuration: 3))
 *  ```
 *
 *  Finally, here's how two actions can be linked togher to be performed at the same time:
 *
 *  ```
 *  actor.move(byX: 50, y: 300, duration: 5)
 *       .also(actor.fadeOut(withDuration: 3))
 *  ```
